end_pos.m	                Calculates the position of the end effector using angles between the arms.  
Jacobian.m	                Consists of the function which calculates the Jacobian of the robotic system  
Jacobian_Convergence.m	    Calculates the position of end effector at each iteration of the transpose method and displays the converging and diverging case.  
make_smatrix.m	          Converts linear path into n sub intervals and returns all the target points.  
mid_pos.m                   Calculates the position of the mid joint.  
theta_Calculation.m	    Calculates set of joint angles for the target position of end effector  
Path_tracking.m 	          Main file that calculates and combines all the base functions and performs simulation of the results
